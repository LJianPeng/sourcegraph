# [Title]

[A very brief explanation of this plan.]

Owner(s): [Who will implement this plan?]
Code reviewer(s): [Who will review code associated with this plan?]

## Background

[A description of the problem that this plan addresses along with any other relevant context.]

## Plan

[A precise statement of the planned work.]

### Test plan

[A description of how the planned work will be tested in an automated way.]

### Release plan

[A description of how the planned work will be released to users (e.g. feature flags, automatic data migrations, etc.).]

### Success metrics

[The metrics that will be used to measure the success of this plan.]

### Company goals

[An explanation of how this plan advances one of the current [company goals](company-goals.md).]

## Analysis

[A discussion of alternate approaches and the trade offs, advantages, disadvantages, risks, and uncertainties of the planned approach.]

## Checklist 

[An ordered checklist that enumerates what needs to be done in as much detail as possible. This provides evidence that you have sufficiently thought through what needs to be done. Provide relative time estimates in hours or days for each item (or groups of items if the items are small). This makes it possible to determine if the project is on track relative to the planned done date.]

- [ ] Create a GitHub issue with the contents of this checklist.
- [ ] Update this plan with a link to the live checklist.
- [ ] Insert implementation tasks here...
- [ ] Schedule retrospective

Live checklist: [Add link here (e.g. https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/1534).]

## Done date

[The date that all goals of the project will be accomplished. This is a firm commitment that we can communicate to anyone (e.g. internal team, external customers). As such, the date should account for reasonably forseeable factors that could impact the it (including, but not limited to, necessary refactoring, testing, fixing bugs, etc.), discounting by probability. If at any point the project is at risk of not being completed by the done date, communicate that risk immediately and discuss what corrective action should be taken with your manager.]

## Retrospective

[The preceeding sections are immutable once a plan is approved and merged. Once the project is complete, schedule a meeting with everyone involved in the project, including the owners' managers to discuss how the project went and complete the following sections.]

### Actual checklist

[The checklist that was actually completed (i.e. paste the final checklist from the issue that was used throughout the project). Explain any differences from the original checklist in the plan.]

### Actual done date

[The date that the project was actually finished. Explain why this is earlier or later than originally planned or explain why the project was not completed.]

### Learnings

[What went well? What could have gone better? What should we do differently moving forward?]
